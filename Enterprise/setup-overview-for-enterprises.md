# Deploy Office 365 Enterprise for your organization

Are you ready to deploy Office 365 Enterprise, integrate it with your on-premises infrastructure, and enable your employees to take advantage of cloud-based productivity and collaboration?

This article describes two deployment options, whether you want help or are doing it on your own. In each case, Microsoft provides a guided path for you to follow for deployment success.

## Do-it-yourself guided deployment of Office 365 Enterprise

Deploying Office 365 Enterprise on your own requires that you perform detailed research to make the design decisions that streamline Office 365 service configuration and user adoption. Go to [Plan for Office 365 Enterprise](get-your-organization-ready-for-office-365.md) to start planning your deployment.

To deploy Office 365 Enterprise on your own after completing your planning, these are the recommended steps.

1. [Set up your network](set-up-network-for-office-365.md)

   Includes adding your Internet domains and optimizing the network performance for your on-premises users.
 
2. [Set up your identities](protect-your-global-administrator-accounts.md)

   Includes determining an identity model (cloud-only or hybrid), and for hybrid identity, setting up directory synchronization between your on-premises Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS) and your Office 365 subscription.

3. [Implement security](https://docs.microsoft.com/office365/securitycompliance/security-roadmap)

   Includes configuring and rolling out basic and enhanced security, threat, and information protections for your tenant and identities in the first 30 days, 90 days, and beyond.
 
4. [Deploy client software](https://docs.microsoft.com/DeployOffice/deployment-guide-microsoft-365-apps)

   Includes deploying Microsoft 365 Apps for enterprise (previously named Office 365 ProPlus), the cloud-updated and always-current version of the Office suite (Word, Excel, PowerPoint, and others) on your devices. Every Office 365 client license includes a license for Microsoft 365 Apps for enterprise.
 
5. [Set up mobile device management](https://support.office.com/article/set-up-mobile-device-management-mdm-in-office-365-dd892318-bc44-4eb1-af00-9db5430be3cd)

   Office 365 Enterprise includes mobile device management capabilities that help you secure and manage your users' mobile devices.
 
6. [Configure services and applications](configure-services-and-applications.md)

   Includes information on migration of your data and links to articles that get you started on key Office 365 services such as Exchange Online, SharePoint Online, and Teams.
