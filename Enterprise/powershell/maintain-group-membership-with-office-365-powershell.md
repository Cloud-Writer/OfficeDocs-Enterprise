# Maintain group membership with PowerShell for Microsoft 365

You can use PowerShell for Microsoft 365 as an alternative to the Microsoft 365 admin center to maintain group membership in Microsoft 365. 

> [!TIP]
> To generate ready-to-run PowerShell commands by specifying user account and group names, use this [group maintenance Microsoft Excel workbook](https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/OfficeDocs-Enterprise/raw/live/Enterprise/media/maintain-group-membership-with-office-365-powershell/GroupMaintPowerShellGenerator.xlsx). 

## Use the Azure Active Directory PowerShell for Graph module
First, [connect to your Microsoft 365 tenant](connect-to-office-365-powershell.md#connect-with-the-azure-active-directory-powershell-for-graph-module).

### Add or remove user accounts as members of a group

**To add a user account by its UPN**, fill in the user account User Principal Name (UPN) (example: belindan@contoso.com) and the group display name, removing the “<” and “>” characters, and run these commands in the PowerShell window or the PowerShell Integrated Script Environment (ISE).

```powershell
$userUPN="<UPN of the user account to add>"
$groupName="<display name of the group>"
Add-AzureADGroupMember -RefObjectId (Get-AzureADUser | Where { $_.UserPrincipalName -eq $userUPN }).ObjectID -ObjectId (Get-AzureADGroup | Where { $_.DisplayName -eq $groupName }).ObjectID
```

**To add a user account by its display name**, fill in the user account display name (example: Belinda Newman) and the group display name and run these commands in the PowerShell window or the PowerShell ISE.

```powershell
$userName="<display name of the user account to add>"
$groupName="<display name of the group>"
Add-AzureADGroupMember -RefObjectId (Get-AzureADUser | Where { $_.DisplayName -eq $userName }).ObjectID -ObjectId (Get-AzureADGroup | Where { $_.DisplayName -eq $groupName }).ObjectID
```

**To remove a user account by its UPN**, fill in the user account UPN (example: belindan@contoso.com) and the group display name and run these commands in the PowerShell window or the PowerShell ISE.

```powershell
$userUPN="<UPN of the user account to remove>"
$groupName="<display name of the group>"
Remove-AzureADGroupMember -MemberId (Get-AzureADUser | Where { $_.UserPrincipalName -eq $userUPN }).ObjectID -ObjectID (Get-AzureADGroup | Where { $_.DisplayName -eq $groupName }).ObjectID
```

**To remove a user account by its display name**, fill in the user account display name (example: Belinda Newman) and the group display name and run these commands in the PowerShell window or the PowerShell ISE.

```powershell
$userName="<display name of the user account to remove>"
$groupName="<display name of the group>"
Remove-AzureADGroupMember -MemberId (Get-AzureADUser | Where { $_.DisplayName -eq $userName }).ObjectID -ObjectID (Get-AzureADGroup | Where { $_.DisplayName -eq $groupName }).ObjectID
```

### Add or remove groups as members of a group

Security groups can contain other groups as members. Microsoft 365 groups, however, cannot. This section contains PowerShell commands to add or remove groups only for a security group.

**To add a group by its display name**, fill in the display name of the group you’re going to add and the display name of the group that will contain the member group and run these commands in the PowerShell window or the PowerShell ISE.

```powershell
$groupMemberName="<display name of the group to add>"
$groupName="<display name of the group that will contain the member group>"
Add-AzureADGroupMember -RefObjectId (Get-AzureADGroup | Where { $_.DisplayName -eq $groupMemberName }).ObjectID -ObjectID (Get-AzureADGroup | Where { $_.DisplayName -eq $groupName }).ObjectID
```

**To remove a group by its display name**, fill in the display name of the group you’re going to remove and the display name of the group that will contain the member group and run these commands in the PowerShell window or the PowerShell ISE.

```powershell
$groupMemberName="<display name of the group to add>"
$groupName="<display name of the group that will contain the member group>"
Remove-AzureADGroupMember -MemberId (Get-AzureADGroup | Where { $_.DisplayName -eq $groupMemberName }).ObjectID -ObjectID (Get-AzureADGroup | Where { $_.DisplayName -eq $groupName }).ObjectID
```

## Use the Microsoft Azure Active Directory Module for Windows PowerShell

```powershell
$userUPN="<UPN of the user account to add>"
$groupName="<display name of the group>"
Add-MsolGroupMember -GroupMemberObjectId (Get-MsolUser | Where { $_.UserPrincipalName -eq $userUPN }).ObjectID -GroupObjectId (Get-MsolGroup | Where { $_.DisplayName -eq $groupName }).ObjectID
```
